# adaptive-desktop
Adaptive desktops for Windows based off of weather and time (time coming soon)

## Setup:
1. Input your longitude and latitude in config.json to the `lon` and `lat` values(you can google the coordinates of your city)
2. Get your API key at https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys after making an account, then add it to the JSON file
3. Add your absolute file path using double backslashes as the seperator, e.g:
```
C:\\Users\\myUser\\Desktop\\Backgrounds
```
**This needs to be the _absolute_ file path starting with your drive letter, not the relative file path.**
